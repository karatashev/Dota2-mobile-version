# Dota2-mobile-version

You can check:
- laptop version:  https://dota2-laptop-version.netlify.app/
- mobile verison:  https://dota2-mobile-version.netlify.app/

I deployed the site separately becouse i didn't want to have hamburger menu on the laptop-version and im using only CSS

Very cool website that i made while practicing HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid. 
There is also a mobile version with Hamburger Menu only made with CSS.
